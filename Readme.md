## Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
## Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.
### Markdown is a **Text-to-HTML conversion tool** for web writers. Markdown allows  you to write using an *easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it  to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)*.

## How to Write Markdown ..??

* Go to GitHub
* Create a new repo and ask that it have a `README.md` file created.
* Edit the README.md file to contain any Markdown you want.
* Then flip over to the “Preview changes” tab
Each time you switch to that tab, Github converts the Markdown that  you wrote to HTML and displays the results.
